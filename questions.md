1. Assign to the value `6` to the variable `number_six`
 = number_six = 6
2. What is the datatype of `"Matz"`?
= String

3. What do the following expressions evaluate to:
  * `"Cool" + "Cool" + "Cool"` = CoolCoolCool
  * `t = "Troy"
    a = "Abed"
    "#{t} and #{a} in the Morning"` = Troy and Abed in the Morning
  * `10 * 3`    = 30
  * `10 ** 3`  = 1000
  * `10 % 3` = 1
  * `10 / 3`   = 3
  * `0.7 + 0.1`  = 0.8
4. Can you explain why the expressions all give the same result?
  * `"Ronnie " + "Pickering"`
  * `"Ronnie ".+("Pickering")`
  * `"Ronnie ".send(:+, "Pickering")`
5. Please fix the following buggy expressions:
  * `number_six = 6`
  * `"Maroon" + 5.to_s`
  * `true == false`
